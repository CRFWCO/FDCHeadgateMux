# FDCHeadgateMux

Here we can describe this site/MUX and/or add additional information.

* Talk to remote Raspberry Pi via Dataplicity
* Consider updating RPI after logging in (unlike Windows, Linux systems don't update themselves randomly - you need to ask first!).To do this enter *sudo apt update*, then *sudo apt upgrade*. You may need to enter y for yes if it asks if you're sure. Also, you may get kicked out of Dataplicity while it's updating (dataplicity might be updating). Be patient till updates are finished.
